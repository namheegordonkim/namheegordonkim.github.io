## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Aalto University and the research group lead of [the MIME Lab](https://mimelab.github.io/).
Prior to that, I received a M.Sc. from the University of British Columbia, advised by Professor [Michiel van de Panne](https://cs.ubc.ca/~van/).

I have previously worked at UBC as a sessional lecturer in machine learning and data mining, at Ubisoft La Forge as an R&D intern, at Amazon as a software engineer (AWS RDS, Delivery Experience) and data scientist (AWS SageMaker), and at Medical Informations Corp as a frontend developer.
My research is funded by Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC).

## Research Interests

My work lies in the intersection of computer animation and machine learning, with a focus of reinforcement learning and physical simulation as a driver of behaviour emergence for various character morphologies and interaction scenarios.
